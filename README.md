## Supported OS
- Windows
- macOS (>= Big Sur, offering universal binary for Intel and Apple Silicon)


## Download

Released binaries are able in [here](https://github.com/pjessesco/ChollianWallPaper/releases/).
Under-development/debug versions are available in [github actions](https://github.com/pjessesco/ChollianWallPaper/actions).


## Dependency

- CMake
- curl
- Qt6

 
## Build

### macOS
 
1. Build Qt>=6.2.0 
2. Build OpenSSL and CURL using `scripts/build_openssl_curl.sh` 
3. Build Chollian Wallpaper using CMake.
4. Refer [github workflow](https://github.com/pjessesco/ChollianWallPaper/blob/main/.github/workflows/macOS.yml) for more details (CMake parameters, etc).


Building Qt can be replaced with installing it using homebrew, and CURL is embedded in macOS natively. Reason for building them is to offer universal binary for both Intel/Apple Silicon. See [2021.10](https://github.com/pjessesco/ChollianWallPaper/tree/2021.10) how we've done it before with homebrew.


### Windows

1. Install [Qt6](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)

2. Download pre-built curl. [link](https://curl.se/download.html)

3. Set environment variables.

4. Run below commands

-

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCURL_LIBRARY=path/to/libcurl.dll.a -DCURL_INCLUDE_DIR=path/to/include ..
    MSBuild.exe PACKAGE.vcxproj -p:Configuration=Release
