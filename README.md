Inspired by [himawaripy](https://github.com/boramalper/himawaripy), ChollianWallPaper is simple GUI app that aims to set near-realtime image from [Chollian 2A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chollian) as wallpaper.

## Features

 - Various image resolution from 360p to 8K
 - Various image ratio (4:3, 16:9, 16:10)
 - 2 download options :
     - `Quality` for higher image quality
     - `Performance` for lower memory/network usage

## Supported OS
- Windows
- macOS (>= Big Sur, Universal binary is supported in development build)


## Download

Release binaries are able in [here](https://github.com/pjessesco/ChollianWallPaper/releases/).
Under-development/debug versions are available in [here](https://github.com/pjessesco/ChollianWallPaper/actions).


## Dependency

- CMake
- curl
- Qt6

 
## Build

### macOS
 
1. Build Qt>=6.2.0 and CURL.
2. Build Chollian using cmake.
3. Refer [github workflow](https://github.com/pjessesco/ChollianWallPaper/blob/main/.github/workflows/macOS.yml) for more details.


Building Qt can be replaced with installing it using homebrew, and CURL is embedded in macOS natively. Reason for building them is to offer universal binary for both Intel/Apple Silicon, and `scripts/bundle_macos.py` is written for the case.  See [2021.10](https://github.com/pjessesco/ChollianWallPaper/tree/2021.10) how we've done it before with homebrew.


### Windows

1. Install [Qt6](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)

2. Download pre-built curl. [link](https://curl.se/download.html)

3. Set environment variables.

4. Run below commands

-

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCURL_LIBRARY=path/to/libcurl.dll.a -DCURL_INCLUDE_DIR=path/to/include ..
    MSBuild.exe PACKAGE.vcxproj -p:Configuration=Release
